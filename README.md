Schematics etc for split 62-key 60% keyboard.

Unlike other split keyboards such as ergodox, this design uses a single switch matrix by sharing more lines between PCBs. Essentially a variant of ANSI GH60 in terms of grid layout (should work with the same firmware), with one extra programmable spacebar (right side spacebar will not function without modified firmware).

## Status

Currently in early stages.

* 2020-09-04 - Probably not final, but first potentially viable schematic.
