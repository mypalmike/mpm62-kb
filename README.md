Schematics etc for split 62-key 60% keyboard.

Left side uses an arduino pro micro with left-side exit. Right side uses expander. Simple 4-pin connector carries i2c.

## Status

Currently in early stages.

* 2020-09-04 - Probably not final, but first potentially viable schematic.
* 2020-09-06 - Right-side (more complex) PCB routing complete.
* 2020-09-30 - (branch) Both sides updated for throughhole solder and expander to simplify wiring.
